# Safe Weakly hard Specification Synthesis

A novel synthesis framework is proposed for synthesising such safe weakly hard specifications given a hybrid system model along with its desired performance and safety boundaries. It internally uses [Flow star](https://github.com/chenxin415/flowstar). The proposed framework offers more scalability and more precise approximation of safety boundaries compared to the state-of-the-art [[1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3302504.3311811)],[[2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_26)],[[3](https://eskang.github.io/assets/papers/rv20b.pdf#page=3.14)].
