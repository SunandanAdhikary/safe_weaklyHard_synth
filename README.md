# Safe Weakly hard Specification Synthesis

A novel synthesis framework is proposed for synthesising such safe weakly hard specifications given a hybrid system model along with its desired performance and safety boundaries. The proposed framework offers more scalability and more precise approximation of safety boundaries compared to the
state-of-the-art.
